## Join the chat
First step is to join one of the chat channels to meet everyone. [#ethberlin](https://get.status.im/chat/public/ethberlin) is the official communications channel and there is a spin-off, [#buidlyourberlinteam](https://get.status.im/chat/public/buidlyourberlinteam), to introduce yourself and say what you're interested. Since a few days ago, we have a Matrix [channel](https://matrix.to/#/!WTJBLneNDtLzLNlkmU:matrix.org) too! There are multiple clients for Matrix, for example Rocket (centralized) and Riot (federated), pick your choice.

## Ideas as guiding lights
Go to the [issues](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding/issues) to see the ideas hackers are sharing, and jump in the conversation if you find some interesting, there's a great opportunity to meet your future team members here! If you already have an idea your dying to execute, well, why not share it, to get some feedback, and to find interested people.

### Submitting your idea
Have a look at [#1](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding/issues/1) to get an idea how the issue for your idea could look like. Not everything in there is mandatory, and feel free to change the structure if your idea doesn't quite fit to them, but please try to have a clear structure to make it easier for people looking at the issue to get some important information out of it quickly. In the example, we're using [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to structure the issue. The title is an h3 heading, and the rest are h4 headings. Create the issue with a `idea` label, and additionally with a `join us` label if you're looking for team members.
