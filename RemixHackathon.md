# ETHBerlin Remix hackathon

First please join https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix-dev-plugin ;)

Welcome to this Remix hackathon!
We are really happy to see new people involved in improving tools ;)

This document aims to give more understanding about this hackathon.

Important! You don't need to be a killer blockchain dev for participating, just being a curious developer and have a basic understanding of Ethereum tech.

## Introduction

Remix is a suite of tools written in JavaScript used for developing smart contracts,
It contains the following packages:

https://github.com/ethereum/remix
 - remix-lib
 - remix-debug (contract debugging)
 - remix-analysis (solidity static analysis)
 - remix-solidity (solidity compiler)
 - remix-tests (smart contract unit testing)

https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide
 - remix-ide (IDE - remix.ethereum.org)

https://github.com/ethereum/remixd
 - remixd (accessing local files from remix IDE)

`https://remix.ethereum.org` host remix IDE web application, used to write, analyze, test and debug Ethereum smart contracts.

We have recently published an update that provides a way to develop external plugin.

The purpose of this hackathon is to build plugins for Remix.

## General overview

Here we describe basic information about this event.

 - Each team should have at least one person present at the event.
 - Each team should choose a plugin from the plugin list. https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Remix-IDE+%3Adesktop_computer%3A%22
 - Please come to us prior starting, it is better to have a clear overview of who is working on what.
 - Feel free to communicate and ask question in https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix-dev-plugin .
 - If the plugin is already taken by another team, you can still take it, but we really encourage you to work with the other team rather than competing with them.
 - The development reward for each listed plugin is $500. This amount will be released at the end of the hackathon or shortly after, if the evaluation team considers that completed work was helpful.
 - You are still completely free to bring your own ideas. Please reach out and ask us if you want your idea to be funded.
 - At the end of the hackathon or shortly after, the evaluation team will select a maximum of 4 teams that will receive a sponsorship.
 - To evaluate your development, we need you to provide a document describing your work (see the "Document" section).
 - The ultimate plan is for us to continue working together. So please, keep in contact with us after event.

## Evaluation team

The evaluation team is composed of people from the EF. We are here for:
 - Helping you on technical matters and to find the right person to answer technical question.
 - Selecting the 4 teams that will receive sponsorship.
 - Validating funded plugins.
 - Advising you if you wish to be more involved in the Ethereum community.
 
## Document

This document should contains:
    -  General description of the project.
    -  Contact of involved people.
    -  Github repository where the project is stored.
    -  Description about how to make it work.
    -  What is left to be done in order to be usable in production.
    -  What were the main problems you encountered while developing and how did you solve them.
    -  What should have been done differently -if that applies.
    -  How would it be possible to extend contribution beyond the current project.
    
We really recommend to take time for that if you want to apply for a sponsorship.

## Setting up the development environement

Here is a quick description that will help you to setup a dev environment:
The plugin API uses iframe to talk to Remix. 
https://github.com/ethereum/remix/blob/master/docs/remix_plugin.md
https://github.com/ethereum/remix/blob/master/docs/remix_plugin_api.md


We explain here how to get `remix-plugin`. A package that abstracts the `iframe` layer in order to make the development easier.

### easy way: cloning the sample project and setting up the plugin

follow the README of https://github.com/yann300/remix-plugin

### manual setup: building the Remix API lib and setting up the plugin

git clone https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide
npm install
cd src/app/plugin

npm install
npm run browserify
This will generate the file `bundle.js`. Reference this file in any html page to start using the API.

Once you have this `bundle.js` (or `require('remix-plugin')`)

Create a folder (not necessarily in Remix) where the plugin code should go.
copy `bundle.js` to it.
Go in `test-browser/plugin` from the remix-ide project and copy the file `index.html` and `plugin.js` to your working directory.
Serve this folder through a web server `http-server .`

Go in Remix / settings tab, under the `Plugin` section paste the following declaration:

{
    "title": "<name of plugin>",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:<port>"
}

Then start the plugin by licking on its icon.
